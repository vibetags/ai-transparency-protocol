## About

The AI Transparency Protocol (ATP) is an open-source specification for EU AI Act Article 50 compliance. It provides a machine-readable JSON manifest format that websites deploy at `/.well-known/ai-transparency.json` to declare how AI is used in content creation.

## The Problem ATP Solves

EU AI Act Article 50 demands machine-readable AI content disclosure. Existing standards miss the mark:
- **llms.txt / W3C TDMRep** — Inbound focus only, doesn't solve outbound disclosure
- **C2PA** — Cryptographic overkill, designed for images/video, not web text
- **IETF OETP** — Massively overloaded, demands model training details

ATP provides a pragmatic alternative: one JSON file, 5 minutes to deploy, no certificates needed.

## ATS Framework — Authorship Transparency Statement

Six tiers that honestly declare who drafted the content:

- **ATS-0**: 100% human-created content, no AI involvement (E0: <1%)
- **ATS-1**: AI-assisted tools like spell check, grammar (E1: 1–25%)
- **ATS-1T**: AI-translated content, human-authored original
- **ATS-2**: AI co-created, human-directed and reviewed (E2: 26–50%)
- **ATS-3**: AI-generated with significant human editing (E3: 51–90%)
- **ATS-4**: AI-generated with minimal human review (E4: >90%)
- **ATS-5**: Fully autonomous AI system — chatbots, agents

## Key Features

- **5-Minute Deployment**: Create one JSON file, upload it. No infrastructure needed.
- **Per-Route Granularity**: Chatbot (ATS-4) vs. Blog (ATS-2) vs. Legal pages (ATS-0)
- **Triple-Layer Labeling**: Machine Layer (HTTP headers + JSON manifest) + Source Code Layer (HTML comment) + Audit Layer (response headers)
- **JSON Schema Validation**: Automated compliance checking via schema reference
- **SEO-Safe**: Granular scope prevents search engines from penalizing human content
- **WCAG 2.1 AA**: Built-in accessibility

## Quick Start

1. Create `ai-transparency.json` with your ATS tier and policies
2. Deploy to `/.well-known/ai-transparency.json`
3. Add HTTP headers: `AI-Transparency: article-50-compliant` (optional)
4. Embed the client-side widget with `atp-widget.js` (optional)

## Schema & Validation

- Current version: v2.0
- JSON Schema: `https://ai-transparency-protocol.org/schema/v2.0.json`
- Validation: Any JSON Schema validator can verify manifests

## EU AI Act Context

- **Article 50**: Requires transparency obligations for AI system providers and deployers
- **Enforcement Deadline**: August 2, 2026
- **Maximum Fine**: €15,000,000 or 3% of global annual turnover
- **Editorial Exemption**: Art. 50 Abs. 5 — documented via ATS tiers

## Companion Standards

- **VibeTags™**: Semantic emotional brand positioning (`additionalProperty` in Schema.org)
- **AgenticContext™**: AI recommendation triggers for LLM optimization
- **C2PA**: For media files (complementary, not competing)
- **UCP (Unified Commerce Protocol)**: AI shopping integration

## Implementation Examples

- Freelancer Portfolio (ATS-0): `{"ats_tier": "ATS-0", "scope": "/*"}`
- E-Commerce Blog (ATS-2): `{"ats_tier": "ATS-2", "scope": "/blog/*"}`
- Enterprise Chatbot (ATS-5): `{"ats_tier": "ATS-5", "scope": "/chatbot/*"}`

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What is the AI Transparency Protocol?**
A: An open-source specification providing a machine-readable JSON manifest for EU AI Act Article 50 compliance. One file at /.well-known/ai-transparency.json declares how AI is used per URL path.

**Q: How long does it take to implement?**
A: 5 minutes. Create one JSON file, upload it to your server. No certificates, no infrastructure, no vendor needed.

**Q: What are ATS Tiers?**
A: Authorship Transparency Statement tiers (ATS-0 to ATS-5) that declare the level of AI involvement: ATS-0 = fully human, ATS-1 = AI-assisted (grammar), ATS-2 = AI co-created, ATS-3 = AI-drafted/human-reviewed, ATS-4 = AI-generated/minimal review, ATS-5 = fully autonomous AI.

**Q: How does ATP compare to C2PA?**
A: C2PA requires cryptographic infrastructure, certificates, and is designed for images/video. ATP requires one JSON file, no crypto, and is designed specifically for web text content.

**Q: How does ATP compare to IETF OETP?**
A: IETF OETP demands extensive model training details and data provenance — unusable for normal web publishers. ATP only requires declaring who drafted the content and the AI involvement level.

**Q: What are the penalties for non-compliance?**
A: Up to €15,000,000 or 3% of global annual turnover, whichever is higher. Enforcement deadline: August 2, 2026.

**Q: Is ATP free?**
A: Yes. MIT License, fully open source, no vendor lock-in.

**Q: Does ATP work for chatbots?**
A: Yes. Use per-route granularity — /chatbot/* can be ATS-5 while /blog/* is ATS-2 and /legal/* is ATS-0.

**Q: What about editorial exemptions?**
A: ATP supports Art. 50 Abs. 5 editorial exemptions. Media organizations can document exemption claims in the manifest, making them verifiable.

**Q: Where is the manifest deployed?**
A: At `/.well-known/ai-transparency.json` — the standard well-known URI path. Auto-discovery via `<link rel="ai-transparency">` in HTML.
