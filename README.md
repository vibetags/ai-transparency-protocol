# AI Transparency Protocol

**Machine-readable AI content transparency for the web.**

> An open-source proposal for how websites can declare their use of AI-generated content — per route, per content type, in a single JSON file.

## Why This Exists

The EU AI Act (Article 50) creates new transparency obligations for AI-generated content, effective **August 2, 2026**.

- **Providers** (OpenAI, Google, etc.) must embed machine-readable markers into AI outputs
- **Deployers** (websites publishing AI content on matters of public interest) must disclose AI involvement to users

Providers will solve their part with watermarking (SynthID) and content credentials (C2PA).

But **Deployers** — the millions of websites using AI for blogs, chatbots, product descriptions — have no standardized way to declare: *"This specific page was AI-assisted. That chatbot is fully autonomous. Our legal pages are human-authored."*

That's the gap this protocol addresses.

## Who Is This For?

| You are... | This helps you... |
|---|---|
| **Web publisher** using AI content tools | Declare AI involvement per URL pattern |
| **News site / public interest publisher** | Meet Art. 50 Abs. 4 disclosure obligations |
| **Enterprise with mixed content** | Different transparency levels per section |
| **Compliance officer** | Machine-readable, schema-validated declarations |
| **Developer / CMS vendor** | Standard format to build tools against |

> **Honest note:** If your website doesn't publish AI-generated text on matters of public interest, Article 50 may not legally require you to disclose. But transparency is good practice — and this makes it trivially easy.

## Quick Start

Create `/.well-known/ai-transparency.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://ai-transparency-protocol.org/schema/v2.0.json",
  "eu_ai_act": {
    "article_50_compliant": true,
    "effective_date": "2026-08-02",
    "disclosure_method": ["manifest", "http-header"]
  },
  "policies": [
    {
      "scope": "/chatbot/*",
      "content_types": ["text"],
      "ats_tier": "ATS-5",
      "ats_extent": "E4",
      "human_oversight": false
    },
    {
      "scope": "/blog/*",
      "content_types": ["text", "images"],
      "ats_tier": "ATS-2",
      "ats_extent": "E2",
      "human_oversight": true
    },
    {
      "scope": ["/impressum", "/agb", "/datenschutz"],
      "ats_tier": "ATS-0",
      "description": "Human-authored, no AI disclosure needed."
    }
  ],
  "transparency_policy_url": "https://example.com/ai-transparency",
  "contact": "compliance@example.com"
}
```

Deploy it. Done. That's the entire implementation.

## The Key Idea: Per-Route Granularity

Most transparency approaches treat an entire website as one unit. But websites aren't monolithic:

```
example.com/
├── /chatbot/*     → Fully autonomous AI (ATS-5)
├── /blog/*        → Human-edited, AI-assisted (ATS-2)  
├── /products/*    → AI-drafted descriptions (ATS-3)
├── /legal/*       → 100% human-authored (ATS-0)
└── /reports/*     → AI-generated, human-reviewed (ATS-4)
```

Each route can have its own ATS tier, its own disclosure level, and its own editorial responsibility declaration. This is what makes `ai-transparency.json` useful — and what no other approach currently offers.

## ATS Tiers (Authorship Transparency Statement)

The [ATS Framework](https://github.com/ATS-Framework/ATS-Framework) (January 2026) defines six tiers of AI involvement:

| Tier | Name | Human Role | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ATS-0** | Unaugmented | Sole author, no AI | Legal pages, Impressum |
| **ATS-1** | Augmented | Author; AI refines | Spell-check, grammar, research |
| **ATS-1T** | Transformative | Author; AI translates | One-to-one translation |
| **ATS-2** | Co-Creative | Editor; AI drafts fragments | AI-assisted blog posts |
| **ATS-3** | Generative | Reviewer; AI drafts structure | AI-drafted newsletters |
| **ATS-4** | Autonomous | Oversight; AI generates | Auto-generated reports |
| **ATS-5** | Fully Autonomous | None | Chatbots, autonomous agents |

> **Bright Line:** ATS-2 is where AI starts generating first-pass content. Below that is "reactive use" only.

## How It Compares

| Feature | This Protocol | C2PA | IETF OETP | llms.txt |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Web text focus | ✅ Primary | ⚠️ Emerging | ✅ | ❌ |
| Per-route scope | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Editorial exemption | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| No crypto required | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| JSON Schema validation | ✅ | N/A | ✅ | ❌ |
| 5-min deployment | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

**Important:** These are complementary, not competing. C2PA handles images/video provenance. SynthID handles watermarking. This protocol handles **site-level web text declarations**. A complete transparency stack may use all three.

## Triple-Layer Labeling

The protocol recommends three layers:

```
Layer 1 — Machine:
  → /.well-known/ai-transparency.json manifest
  → HTTP Headers: AI-Transparency: article-50-compliant
  → HTML: <link rel="ai-transparency" href="/.well-known/ai-transparency.json">

Layer 2 — Source Code:
  → HTML comment block with ATS tier, scope, and compliance status
  → Parseable by auditors and compliance crawlers

Layer 3 — User-Facing:
  → WCAG 2.1 AA transparency badge widget (optional)
  → Byline integration: "Author: Jane Doe · ✨ AI co-created"
```

## Examples

See the [examples/](examples/) directory:

- [Site-wide](examples/site-wide.json) — Simplest case, entire site
- [Mixed Content](examples/mixed-content.json) — AI blog + human legal pages
- [Enterprise](examples/enterprise.json) — Multiple routes with different ATS tiers

## Adoption Path

This is **not an official standard**. It's an open-source proposal hoping to become one.

That's how web conventions work:

| Convention | Official at Launch? | Today |
|---|---|---|
| `robots.txt` | ❌ Private proposal (1994) | ✅ Universal standard |
| `security.txt` | ❌ Indie project | ✅ RFC 9116 |
| `ads.txt` | ❌ IAB initiative | ✅ Industry standard |
| **`ai-transparency.json`** | ❌ Open source (2026) | ⏳ Building momentum |

> **Adoption creates standards. Standards don't create adoption.**

## Validate Your Manifest

Every manifest can be validated against the [JSON Schema](schema/v2.0.json):

```bash
# Using ajv-cli
npx ajv validate -s schema/v2.0.json -d your-manifest.json

# Or just curl and check
curl -s https://your-site.com/.well-known/ai-transparency.json | python3 -m json.tool
```

## EU AI Act Context

- **Article 50** — Transparency obligations for providers and deployers of AI systems
- **Article 50 Abs. 2** — Providers must mark outputs as machine-detectable (Provider obligation)
- **Article 50 Abs. 4** — Deployers must disclose AI text published on matters of public interest
- **Article 50 Abs. 5** — Disclosure must be clear, distinguishable, and accessible (WCAG)
- **Editorial exemption** — If AI text undergoes human review and someone holds editorial responsibility, the Deployer disclosure obligation may not apply

> **This protocol does not claim to make anyone "Article 50 compliant" by itself.** Compliance is a legal assessment that depends on your specific situation, content type, and role (Provider vs. Deployer). This protocol provides a standardized technical mechanism for the disclosure part of that compliance.

## Specification

See [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) for the formal specification, including:
- Complete schema reference
- Article 50 paragraph mapping
- HTTP header conventions
- Source Code Declaration format
- Client-side widget recommendations

## Ethical Principles

See [ETHICS.md](ETHICS.md) — transparency is not optional, complexity hinders compliance, and this protocol should prevent compliance washing, not enable it.
